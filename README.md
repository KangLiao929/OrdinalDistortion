> ### Problem
> Given a radial distortion image capture by wide-angle lens, this work aims to predict the ordinal distortion and rectify the distortion.
>  ### Features
>  * Propose a learning-friendly representatiion (ordinal distortion) for wide-angle image rectification, which is customized for neural networks and solves a more straightforward estimation problem than the traditional distortion parameter regression
>  * Ordinal distortion is homogeneous as all its elements share a similar magnitude and description, compared with the heterogeneous distortion parameter
>  * Ordinal distortion can be estimated using only a part of a wide-angle image, enabling higher efficiency of rectification algorithms
